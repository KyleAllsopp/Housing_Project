# Housing_Project

For this project I utilized the `California Housing Prices dataset` sourced from the StatLib repository. This dataset originates from the 1990 California census, making it not particularly recent.

However, it possesses valuable attributes for learning, and for the purposes of this exercises, I treated it as if it were more current data.

The following are the main steps I cover in this project:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.


The end goal of this project was to implement an end-to-end machine learning project for my github that utilized a real life example (here the use of housing data).
